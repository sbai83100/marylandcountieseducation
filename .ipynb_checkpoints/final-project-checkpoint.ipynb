    "Society has long been rooted in inequality and unequal distribution of wealth. The reason why education is valued so much is because it attempts to \"level\" the playing field for people across different backgrounds. The theory is that a \"miracle\" individual who comes from a poor background can achieve the same level of success in life as someone who came from a wealthy background because of a good education. Many colleges and universities take great pride in accepting first-generation and BIPOC students because it increases their diversity. But what if the so-called \"equalizing\" education is not equal in itself?"

(*Baltimore City, although a municipality, has been considered on a par with county jurisdictions since the adoption of the Maryland Constitution of 1851.*). To say that all twenty-four of these counties are equal in terms of income, quality of life, and workforce (to name a few) would be a gross statement. Differences in population, crime rate, and poverty (to name a few) exist throughout. All of these factors can influence how an individual is raised and taught to enter society as a self-sustaining citizen."

    "Analyzing how education is affected by demographics, quality of life, taxes, and workforce is no easy task. This project only analyzed one of possibly *many* relationships between different variables. However, we've learned some important and interesting insights by merging multiple datasets together and determining correlations between certain factors to explore meaningful relationships. I believe these insights are related to deeper patterns and relationships that could explain why education may not be the \"equalizer\" and instead may have conformed to inequality.\n",

Then we analyzed our data, using data visualization tools to learn more about the data that we have and highlight possible relationships between certain variables. We then used that knowledge to explore in greater detail the relationship between two variables using a linear regression and residual analysis.  \n",
